# PLAN.md: Canonical Pastebin (bingo) — Go Re-implementation

## 1. Project Context & Vision

The goal of this project is to replace Canonical's outdated, legacy Pastebin
application with a modern, maintainable, 12-Factor compliant workload named
**bingo**.

The old Pastebin applications (`pastebin.canonical.com` and `paste.ubuntu.com`) will
be decommissioned with Prodstack 5. **bingo** will launch on **Prodstack 7** as a
greenfield deployment — users are expected to migrate themselves; there is no
automated data migration or backwards-compatible URL routing.

The Python/Django-based `dpaste` project[^1] is used as a **conceptual reference**
for this re-implementation. `dpaste` is a simple ~500-line Django application and the
agent should have no difficulty producing an equivalent Go version informed by its
business logic and feature set. The `dpaste` codebase will be included in the
workspace context for reference.

We are building this from scratch using **Go (Golang)**, exposing a strict **JSON
API**, with a **React + TypeScript** frontend styled via Canonical's Pragma[^2]
component library.

## 2. Repository Structure: Mono-repo

This project uses a **single mono-repo** (`bingo-k8s-operator`) containing both the
Go application workload and the Canonical 12-Factor OCI charm, modeled on the
`github-runner-operators`[^3] repository pattern.

The Go workload follows the community project layout[^4]: thin entry points under
`cmd/`, all business logic under `internal/`. The charm is a thin Python layer using
`paas_charm.go.Charm` — the `go-framework` extension owns reconciliation.

## 3. Technical Stack & Architecture

### Backend

| Component | Choice | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Language | Go 1.22+ | Standard library first |
| Routing | `net/http` (enhanced `ServeMux`) | Go 1.22 method-based routing; no framework |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Attached resource, stateless app |
| DB Driver | `pgx/v5`[^5] via `database/sql` | Modern, maintained; **not** `lib/pq` |
| Migrations | `golang-migrate`[^6] | Versioned `.sql` files |
| Logging | `log/slog` (structured, JSON) | Streams to `stdout`/`stderr` (12-factor) |
| Auth | OIDC via Identity Platform (CIdP) | Associate pastes with authenticated users |
| Config | Environment variables exclusively | 12-factor; `.env.example` documents all vars |

[^5]: pgx — <https://github.com/jackc/pgx>
[^6]: golang-migrate — <https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate>

### Frontend

| Component | Choice | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Framework | React + TypeScript | Canonical's standard for interactive web apps |
| CSS Framework | Vanilla Framework[^11] | Canonical's design system; keeps bingo visually consistent with other Canonical websites |
| Components | Pragma[^2] React components (`@canonical/react-components`), built on Vanilla[^11] | React-native; used by MAAS UI[^16], Juju Dashboard[^17], snapcraft.io, ubuntu.com/pro |
| Syntax Highlighting | Client-side via `react-syntax-highlighter`[^12] | Confirmed choice: ~7.5M weekly downloads, actively maintained, TypeScript types, broad coverage (highlight.js + Prism). API transfers language metadata only |
| Build | Vite (or CRA replacement) | Fast dev server, optimized production builds |
| Testing | Vitest (unit) + Playwright (e2e) | Full frontend coverage |

**Frontend workflow:** React renders the UI (paste form, paste viewer, syntax
highlighting) client-side, styled with Canonical's Vanilla Framework[^11] so the look
and feel matches other Canonical web properties. It fetches data from the Go JSON API
via HTTP. Pragma[^2] components (which implement Vanilla) plug in directly as React
components.

### Deployment & CI

| Component | Choice | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Packaging | OCI rock (`bingo-rockcraft.yaml`) | Built from `cmd/bingo` |
| Charm | `charmcraft.yaml` (go-framework) | Wraps the rock as `app-image` resource |
| CI System | `charm-ci`[^7] (NOT `operator-workflows`) | `artifacts.yaml` + `spread.yaml` + `concierge.yaml` |
| Go CI | `go test`, `golangci-lint`, coverage ≥ 85% | `internal_tests.yaml` |
| Frontend CI | lint, unit tests, e2e tests | `frontend_tests.yaml` |

## 4. Authentication: OIDC via Identity Platform

Authentication uses **OIDC** (OpenID Connect) connected to the new Canonical Identity
Platform (CIdP). **OIDC must be supported, but it is not required to use the
application.** Anonymous pastes are allowed, and operators must be able to deploy
bingo without configuring an identity provider.

### Purpose

When OIDC is configured and a user logs in, their pastes are associated with their
identity (`owner_id` is populated). Authenticated users gain:

- A "my pastes" view listing their own pastes.
- Ownership and attribution of the pastes they create.

When OIDC is not configured, or a user chooses not to log in, pastes are created
anonymously (`owner_id` is `NULL`). Anonymous pastes are not listed under any
"my pastes" view and expose no owner-only actions.

### Security Considerations

- **Token validation:** All OIDC tokens must be validated server-side (signature,
  issuer, audience, expiry) before trusting claims.
- **Session management:** Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Strict cookies for session
  state. Never expose tokens to JavaScript.
- **CSRF protection:** All state-changing API requests from the frontend must include
  CSRF tokens.
- **CORS:** Restrict allowed origins to the production domain(s). Do not use wildcard
  origins in production.
- **Authorization:** Only the owner of an owned paste can delete it. Verify ownership
  server-side on every privileged action. When authentication is enabled, owner-only
  actions require a valid session; requests for those actions without one are rejected
  with `401`. Anonymous pastes have no owner and expose no owner-only actions.

### Implementation

- OIDC middleware in `internal/auth/` handles the authorization code flow callback,
  token refresh, and session binding.
- The Go API reads user identity from the validated session and injects it into the
  request context.
- Configuration via environment variables: `OIDC_ISSUER_URL`, `OIDC_CLIENT_ID`,
  `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL`. These are **optional** — when they are
  unset, authentication is disabled, the application still starts and serves traffic,
  and every paste is created anonymously.

---

## 5. Feature Requirements

Referencing `dpaste`[^1] as the conceptual baseline:

### Core Features

- **Paste creation & retrieval:** Submit raw text with syntax highlighting metadata
  (language key), return a unique key via JSON, fetch paste content + metadata via
  JSON API.
- **Unique key generation:** Base62, collision-resistant, starting at 4 chars; on
  `UNIQUE` violation, retry with length + 1 (dpaste pattern).
- **Expiration (mandatory):** Every paste expires. Allowed durations: `1d`, `1w`,
  `1mo`, `3mo` (default), `1y` (max). No keep-forever option.
- **Deletion:** Only the owner of an owned paste (the authenticated user who created
  it) can delete it. Ownership is enforced server-side via `owner_id`. Anonymous
  pastes have no owner and are removed only by expiry.
- **Raw endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/pastes/{key}/raw` returns `text/plain` (curl-friendly).
- **Language registry:** `GET /api/v1/languages` serves available syntax languages,
  validated on create.
- **Background expiry sweep:** `DELETE FROM pastes WHERE expires_at < now();` plus
  lazy expiry on `GET` (expired → `404` + delete).
- **Rate limiting:** Per-IP token bucket at the API gateway level (out of app scope
  for MVP; app returns `429` errors from the gateway).

### Content Size Limit

Maximum paste content defaults to **5 MiB** (5,242,880 bytes) and is **configurable**
via the `MAX_PASTE_SIZE_BYTES` environment variable, so operators can raise the limit
for users who need larger pastes. Enforced at the API boundary (`413 Content Too
Large`) against the configured value, with a positive-size database CHECK constraint
as a defense-in-depth backstop.

---

## 6. Database Schema (PostgreSQL)

```sql
CREATE TABLE pastes (
    id                BIGINT      GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    key               TEXT        NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    content           TEXT        NOT NULL,
    language          VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'plaintext',
    title             VARCHAR(255),
    size_bytes        INTEGER     NOT NULL,
    expires_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    created_at        TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
    owner_id          BIGINT,                -- NULL for anonymous pastes; set when authenticated

    -- Upper size bound is enforced at the API boundary via MAX_PASTE_SIZE_BYTES
    -- (default 5 MiB); this constraint only guarantees a positive size.
    CONSTRAINT size_positive         CHECK (size_bytes >= 1),
    CONSTRAINT key_length            CHECK (char_length(key) BETWEEN 4 AND 32),
    CONSTRAINT expiry_after_creation CHECK (expires_at > created_at)
);

CREATE INDEX pastes_expires_at_idx ON pastes (expires_at);
CREATE INDEX pastes_owner_id_idx   ON pastes (owner_id);
```

### Database Access Principles

- **`database/sql`, not an ORM** — explicit, debuggable SQL.
- **Repository pattern** — interfaces for data access; implementations hold `*sql.DB`.
- **Entities are plain structs** — no ORM tags; `Scan` into fields explicitly.
- **Always use `Context` variants** — `QueryContext`, `ExecContext`, `QueryRowContext`.
- **Parameterized queries only** — `$1`, `$2` placeholders. **Never** string
  interpolation into SQL.
- **Configure connection pool** — `SetMaxOpenConns`, `SetMaxIdleConns`,
  `SetConnMaxLifetime`.
- **Transactions** — `db.BeginTx(ctx, nil)` with deferred rollback.
- **Always `defer rows.Close()`**.

---

## 7. JSON API (`/api/v1`)

All requests/responses are `application/json` (except `/raw`). Timestamps are RFC 3339
UTC. Endpoints are accessible anonymously by default; when OIDC is enabled, the
"my pastes" listing and owner-only actions (such as deleting an owned paste) require a
valid session.

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/pastes` | Create a paste |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/pastes/{key}` | Retrieve paste content + metadata |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/pastes/{key}/raw` | Raw text/plain body |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/pastes/{key}` | Delete (owner only) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/languages` | Available syntax languages |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/healthz` | Liveness + DB ping |

### Create Request (`POST /api/v1/pastes`)

```json
{
  "content": "print('hello')",
  "language": "python",
  "title": "demo snippet",
  "expires_in": "3mo"
}
```

### Create Response (`201 Created`)

```json
{
  "key": "aB3xY",
  "url": "https://paste.canonical.com/aB3xY",
  "raw_url": "https://paste.canonical.com/api/v1/pastes/aB3xY/raw",
  "language": "python",
  "title": "demo snippet",
  "size_bytes": 14,
  "expires_at": "2026-09-21T12:00:00Z",
  "created_at": "2026-06-23T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### Error Envelope (all 4xx/5xx)

```json
{ "error": { "code": "content_too_large", "message": "Paste exceeds the configured size limit." } }
```

| Status | Codes |
|--------|-------|
| 400 | `invalid_request`, `missing_content`, `invalid_expires_in`, `unknown_language` |
| 401 | `unauthenticated` |
| 403 | `forbidden` (not the paste owner) |
| 404 | `paste_not_found` (also expired) |
| 413 | `content_too_large` |
| 429 | `rate_limited` |
| 500 | `internal_error` |

---

## 8. Security: Input/Output Hardening

Because paste content is user-supplied and rendered in the browser, rigorous hardening
is critical at every layer:

### Backend (Go API)

- **Input validation at the boundary:** reject content larger than the configured
  `MAX_PASTE_SIZE_BYTES` (default 5 MiB), validate `language` against the registry,
  enforce `expires_in` enum, sanitize `title` length.
- **Content scanning:** check submitted content for known exploit patterns (embedded
  `<script>` tags, encoded payloads) before storage. Log and reject suspicious input.
- **Output encoding:** JSON responses must properly escape all user-supplied strings.
  The `encoding/json` package handles this by default — never use raw string
  concatenation for JSON construction.
- **Content-Type headers:** Always set explicit `Content-Type` headers. The `/raw`
  endpoint must return `text/plain; charset=utf-8` with
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent browser MIME-sniffing.
- **Security headers:** All responses include `X-Frame-Options: DENY`,
  `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Content-Security-Policy` with strict directives.

### Frontend (React)

- **Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** with untreated API responses.
- **Sanitize before rendering:** even though React escapes JSX by default, explicitly
  sanitize any content passed to syntax highlighting libraries or rendered outside
  normal JSX text interpolation.
- **CSP enforcement:** The frontend build must support strict Content-Security-Policy
  headers (no `unsafe-inline` for scripts).
- **Validate API responses:** Check response shapes and types before rendering. Do not
  trust that the API response is well-formed — defensive parsing protects against
  compromised backends or MITM.

---

## 9. URL Schema & Routing

### Production URL

- **`https://paste.canonical.com/{key}`** — canonical URL for viewing a paste.
- **`https://paste.canonical.com/`** — default page is the "new paste" form.

### API Routing

- `POST /api/v1/pastes` — create.
- `GET /api/v1/pastes/{key}` — retrieve.
- `GET /api/v1/pastes/{key}/raw` — raw text.
- `DELETE /api/v1/pastes/{key}` — delete.
- `GET /api/v1/languages` — language list.
- `GET /api/v1/healthz` — health check.

**Note:** There is no legacy URL routing. The old `pastebin.canonical.com/p/{id}/` and
`paste.ubuntu.com/p/{id}/` paths are **not supported**. The Ubuntu pastebin will be
decommissioned. Users migrate themselves to the new service.

---

## 10. User Workflow

The application is usable anonymously. When OIDC is enabled, users may optionally log
in to associate pastes with their identity and access the "my pastes" view.

1. **Login (optional)** — when OIDC is enabled, the user may authenticate via OIDC
   (CIdP) to establish a session. Anonymous users skip this step.

2. **Default page** (`/`) is the "new paste" form.
   - Fields: Title (optional), Syntax (from `/api/v1/languages`), Expiration, Content.

3. **After creation**, redirect to `/{key}` showing the paste content.
   - View page shows: creation date, expiry, syntax type, content with client-side
     syntax highlighting, "view raw" link, toggle wrap, copy to clipboard.

4. **Direct navigation** to `/{key}` shows the view page.
   - Expired / missing → `204 No Content` state (the request succeeded;
     there is simply no paste to return).

5. **"New paste" link** visible when viewing an existing paste.

6. **"My pastes"** view lists the authenticated user's own pastes (available only when
   logged in).

---

## 11. Development Process: Test-Driven Development

**TDD is mandatory** for all Go backend and React frontend work. The
**`test-driven-development` skill** from the Superpowers framework[^8] drives the
red → green → refactor loop during agent execution.

[^8]: Superpowers skills framework — <https://github.com/obra/Superpowers>

### TDD Loop (enforced)

1. **Write the test first.** Capture desired behaviour.
2. **Run it and watch it fail.** Confirm it fails for the *expected* reason.
3. **Write the minimum implementation** to make the test pass.
4. **Run tests** — confirm green.
5. **Refactor** with tests as safety net.

### Backend Testing (Go)

- **Standard `testing` package** — no third-party assertion frameworks.
- **Table-driven tests** as the default pattern.
- **`t.Helper()`** on all test helpers.
- **Integration tests** use real PostgreSQL (via `TestMain` setup/teardown) and real
  HTTP transports — not mocks.
- **Coverage gate: ≥ 85%** on `internal/` packages.
- **Cyclomatic complexity: < 10** per function.
- **Linting:** `golangci-lint` with `gofmt`, `govet`, `staticcheck`, `sloglint`.

### Frontend Testing (React)

- **Unit tests** (Vitest): component rendering, utility functions, hook behaviour.
- **End-to-end tests** (Playwright): full user workflows — create paste, view paste,
  delete with token, syntax highlighting rendering.
- **Coverage gate:** enforce meaningful coverage on components and utilities.

### Key Principle

Never write implementation code before a failing test exists for it. Never claim work
is complete without running tests and showing they pass. Use the
**`verification-before-completion` skill** from Superpowers[^8] to confirm all
assertions before declaring done.

---

## 12. Code Style & Standards

### Go Style

- **Primary references:** Canonical's own Go guidelines — Pebble's `STYLE.md`[^13]
  (also used by github-runner-operators), Juju's `STYLE.md`[^14] and Juju's
  `CODING.md`[^15] — to keep bingo consistent with other Canonical Go applications.
  The Google Go Style Guide[^9] is a strong supporting reference and should be
  followed where the Canonical guides are silent.
- **`gofmt`-clean** at all times.
- **Conventional commit** messages.
- **Standard library first** — reach for `net/http`, `database/sql`, `log/slog`,
  `context`, `testing` before adding dependencies.
- **Structured logging** via `log/slog` with JSON output; never log paste content or
  PII.
- **Parameterized queries only** — never interpolate into SQL.

[^9]: Google Go Style Guide — <https://google.github.io/styleguide/go/>

### Go Dependencies (modeled on Canonical projects)

Follow the dependency patterns of Canonical's production Go applications, primarily
Pebble[^10], Juju, and LXD:

- Standard library first.
- `pgx/v5`[^5] for PostgreSQL.
- `golang-migrate`[^6] for migrations.
- `github.com/google/go-cmp` for test struct comparison.
- Avoid heavy frameworks and ORMs.

[^10]: Pebble — <https://github.com/canonical/pebble>

### React/TypeScript Style

- Follow Canonical's web team conventions, as used in MAAS UI[^16] and Juju
  Dashboard[^17].
- Strict TypeScript (`strict: true`).
- Vanilla Framework[^11] via Pragma[^2] components for all UI elements.
- ESLint + Prettier for formatting.

---

## 13. 12-Factor Configuration

All configuration is read exclusively from environment variables. The application
must be fully stateless.

### Required Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `PORT` | HTTP server bind port | `8080` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/bingo` |
| `MAX_PASTE_SIZE_BYTES` | Maximum paste content size in bytes | `5242880` (default, 5 MiB) |
| `OIDC_ISSUER_URL` | OIDC provider URL (CIdP); optional | `https://identity.canonical.com` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` | OIDC client identifier; optional | `bingo-prod` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | OIDC client secret; optional | (secret) |
| `OIDC_REDIRECT_URL` | OAuth callback URL; optional | `https://paste.canonical.com/auth/callback` |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Cookie encryption key; required only when OIDC is enabled | (secret) |
| `BASE_URL` | Public base URL for generated links | `https://paste.canonical.com` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level | `info` |

The `OIDC_*` and `SESSION_SECRET` variables are **optional**: when they are unset,
authentication is disabled and all pastes are anonymous. An `.env.example` file
documents all variables the `12factor-charm` will map to Juju config options.

---

## 14. CI/CD: charm-ci

CI uses Canonical's **`charm-ci`**[^7] reusable workflows — **NOT**
`operator-workflows`. Driven by three declarative files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `artifacts.yaml` | Build manifest: 1 rock + 1 charm + resource binding |
| `spread.yaml` | Test orchestration: integration suite |
| `concierge.yaml` | Environment provisioning: Juju, MicroK8s, LXD |

### Workflows

| Workflow | Responsibility |
|----------|---------------|
| `internal_tests.yaml` | `go test ./...`, coverage ≥ 85%, `golangci-lint` |
| `frontend_tests.yaml` | ESLint, Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e) |
| `charms_lint_and_unit.yaml` | Charm tox: fmt, lint, complexity, static, unit |
| `charms_integration.yaml` | Delegates to charm-ci `integration-test.yml` |
| `publish_charms.yml` | Delegates to charm-ci `publish-artifacts.yml` |

### `artifacts.yaml`

```yaml
version: 1
rocks:
  - name: bingo
    rockcraft-yaml: bingo-rockcraft.yaml
    platforms:
      - arch: amd64
charms:
  - name: bingo
    charmcraft-yaml: charmcraft.yaml
    channel: latest/edge
    resources:
      app-image:
        type: oci-image
        rock: bingo
    platforms:
      - arch: amd64
snaps: []
```

---

## 15. Execution Phases

Execute implementation sequentially. Complete one phase before the next. Use the
`test-driven-development` skill from Superpowers[^8] throughout — every feature
starts with a failing test.

### Phase 1: Backend Initialization & API Skeleton

- Initialize Go module (`go mod init bingo-k8s-operator`).
- Scaffold project structure: `cmd/bingo/main.go`, `internal/server/`,
  `internal/paste/`, `internal/database/`, `internal/key/`, `internal/auth/`.
- Implement HTTP server binding to `$PORT` using `net/http` ServeMux.
- Define all API routes (§7) with stub handlers returning `501 Not Implemented`.
- Write integration test proving the server starts and `/api/v1/healthz` returns 200.
- Set up `golangci-lint` configuration.

### Phase 2: Core Logic & Storage

- Write failing tests for key generation (base62, collision retry).
- Implement key generation in `internal/key/`.
- Write failing tests for paste CRUD (create, get by key, delete, expiry).
- Implement PostgreSQL storage in `internal/paste/postgres.go` with repository
  interface.
- Implement database migrations (`internal/database/migrations/`).
- Implement background expiry sweep (goroutine with ticker).
- Implement boundary validation (configurable max size via `MAX_PASTE_SIZE_BYTES`,
  language, expires_in).
- Wire handlers to real storage; integration tests against real PostgreSQL.

### Phase 3: Authentication (OIDC)

- Implement **optional** OIDC middleware in `internal/auth/`; when `OIDC_*` config is
  absent, authentication is disabled and the app runs in anonymous mode.
- Handle authorization code flow, token validation, session management.
- Allow anonymous access; when authenticated, owner-only actions require a valid
  session and reject missing ones with `401`.
- Populate `owner_id` from the authenticated user when logged in; leave it `NULL` for
  anonymous pastes.
- Add "my pastes" API endpoint (`GET /api/v1/pastes?mine=true`), available only when
  authenticated.
- Security: CSRF tokens, secure cookies, CORS configuration.
- Write tests covering auth flow and authorization checks.

### Phase 4: Frontend (React + Pragma)

- Initialize React + TypeScript project in `web/`.
- Install Vanilla Framework[^11] and Pragma[^2] components
  (`@canonical/react-components`) for Canonical-consistent styling.
- Implement pages: New Paste form, Paste Viewer (with syntax highlighting), empty/
  not-found state.
- Integrate client-side syntax highlighting via `react-syntax-highlighter`[^12].
- Wire API calls to the Go backend.
- Implement input/output hardening (§8): sanitize before render, validate API
  responses, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Implement authenticated "my pastes" view.
- Write unit tests (Vitest) and e2e tests (Playwright) for all user workflows.

### Phase 5: 12-Factor Finalization & Charm

- Verify all config read from environment variables; generate `.env.example`.
- Verify all logs stream structured JSON to stdout/stderr.
- Add security headers middleware (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
